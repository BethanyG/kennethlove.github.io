Hey there.

I feel like I need to start blogging again, so I'm going to give it ago on here.

I'm running the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. So far, it's pretty cool. Builds really fast and is pretty pleasant to use. Blog posts are done in Markdown and have YAML, JSON, or TOML front matter. 
Makes it nicer to configure than constantly having to remember how to do something with YAML or whatever. The theme building is a little hit-or-miss, though. I struggled to get the home page template to work at first 
but got it eventually.

I'm hosting the site on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) using their free, personal plan.

I still need to do quite a bit to the CSS and make sure RSS, `robots.txt`, and other stuff is working.

Alright, that's enough for now.
