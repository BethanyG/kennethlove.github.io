For a long time, people involved in tech have identified themselves by what they
use or produce. For example, I might say "Oh, I'm a Python programmer" or "I
build web sites." Both of these are completely true but they're an interesting
way of labeling ourselves. My dad, as another example, was a mechanic for a long
time. He worked on cars and other vehicles for himself and friends, but at work
he was a mechanic on diesel trucks, the 18-wheeler kind. I don't think I ever
heard him describe himself to anyone as a "Chevy mechanic" or say "I fix Cummins
trucks." It was just "I'm a mechanic" or "I work on trucks."

Now, identifying yourself based on your output or interests isn't a bad thing.
We all use it, even outside of tech, to describe ourselves to others. We might
have a social media bio that says "short fiction writer" or "I like to climb
rocks." The problem comes when we put those descriptions above our opinions of
other people and then use that to discount them, their experiences, or what they
can teach us. I've been referring to this as "tech tribalism" and I want to go
a bit further into it.

I've seen this mostly in two areas: advice to beginners and conferences. Let's
talk about them both. I'm not claiming that any of this is universal or that I'm
some super-woke revelator. I'm definitely not trying to use this to call anyone
out. This post was spurred on by conversations had around a particular tweet
but isn't about anyone involved in that.

## Advice given versus asked for

I'm involved in quite a few communities that cater to, or have a strong presence
from, beginners. So many of them join the community, give their education or
experience background, and immediately ask what they should learn.

Cue suggestions for whatever language, framework, or tool the other, more
experienced (often by just a few months) devs are using themselves. Happen to
be in a community with a lot of PHP devs? You're going to be told to learn
Laravel or Symfony. Maybe you mentioned that you're learning PHP but you're in
a community that's not PHP-heavy? You're going to be told you should use Ruby
or Java or Python or Rust. Oh, you have a problem with Atom? Now comes the
suggestions for Emacs or Vim or VSCode.

Now, nothing is _wrong_ with any of these suggestions. Laravel might be just the
framework that you need to use. Maybe you _should_ build that program in Go
instead. It's entirely possible that the features you like in your editor come
standard in vim or PyCharm.

The problem is that you didn't ask for those suggestions. You just wanted to say
hello, maybe get a list of frameworks to compare. You wanted resources for
learning PHP (because the place you just got an internship uses PHP and you've
been taught Java so far in college). You have Atom set up _just how you like_
except for one thing and you'd rather fix that than learn a whole new editor.

None of this is restricted to beginners, either. I've noticed, though, that these
"helpful" suggestions are sent more to beginners and women.That latter bit just
drips of sexism. Many men seem to assume that women are, by default, beginners
or just less experienced than them. That's a whole 'nother blog post, though,
and likely better written by someone that isn't me.

So, actionable advice, don't give people suggestions or advice they didn't ask
for. Stick to the subject and try to be _helpful_ instead of being "right." Yes,
your stack works for you. Yes, it probably works well. But, in the end, you've
aligned yourself with this tribe that's defined by the technology they use and
anyone or anything outside of that tribe is _wrong_. I hope I don't have to
explain why that's a myopic and dangerous mentality.

## Not Pythonic enough

And now for the meatier subject. I'm involved in several different conferences,
as an organizer, a speaker, and an attendee. One of the things I _love_ to do
when helping out a conference is to review talks. In many conferences, once the
call for proposals is complete, the community is asked to review the talks and
indicate the ones they're most interested in attending.

Some conferences, like DjangoCon US, are pretty lax about the subject matter of
the talks. So long as they're within the realm of Django (Python, web technologies,
deployment, containers, databases, design, ecommerce, Django itself, etc), it's
a talk that's likely to find a home at DjangoCon US.

Other conferences aren't as interested in talks outside of their subject matter.
They want talks to be about the language or framework that the conference is
about. I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't say that it's up to them to set this policy.
But, if I'm honest, I think it's a stupid policy.

We can't learn everything from a single book or video series. Why would we expect
to learn everything only from domain experts in a single domain? I don't know of
any technology that is 100% segregated from everything else. We all have to deal
with traffic on the Internet, or build systems, or security, or documentation.

Be open and welcoming to advice and knowledge coming from other walks of life.
You can learn a lot about a subject by talking to someone who does it *every*
_single day_. I think Hacker News is an amazing example of this. I don't know
of any community that is more convinced that they hold every answer to every
problem inside the community already.

## Diversity of experiences

OK, wait, stop. Don't quit now because you think I'm gonna pull out the "panel
of all white men" defense and say we have a "diversity of thought". That's some
bullshit. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it even if they're not willing
to admit it.
